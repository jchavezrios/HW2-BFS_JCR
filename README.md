# Assignment 2
Breadth-first search

# Assignment Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to get you comfortable working with graph structures and to implement a breadth-first search function to traverse the graph and find the shortest path between nodes.

# Overview of BFS 
The function bfs uses a Breadth-first search algorithm. It first takes in a graph created from an adjacency list, a start node, and an end node. 

It is able to create and traverse graphs made from adjacency list format data as readable by the python package networkx.
